title: 'Sim2Real Reinforcement Learning for Locomotion in Humanoid Robots'
authors:
info: 'Description:
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Due to confidentiality restrictions, I can only share public promotional videos of the robot.</strong></li>
        <li>Train an RL locomotion policy on Isaac Gym.</li>
        <li>Implement the code to control real robots through the RL policy.</li>
        <li>Deploy the policy on real Robot Era&apos;s robot.</li>
        <li>The robot is designed by Prof. Jianyu Chen&apos;s startup.</li>
        <li>We are still working on the RL Sim2Real problem for locomotion. <br/>Our ultimate goal is that the robot can perform various complex locomotion skills.</li>
        <li><strong>If you are interested in this robot or Robot Era, <br/>please feel free to contact Prof. Jianyu Chen or me. : )</strong></li>
