title: 'Sim2Real Reinforcement Learning for Locomotion on Challenging Terrains for Humanoid Robots'
authors:
info: 'Description:
    <ul>
        <li>Train our proposed RL locomotion policy on Isaac Gym.</li>
        <li>Implement the code to control real robots based on ROS.</li>
        <li>Deploy the policy on a custom-designed humanoid robot, StarBot (We call 小星 Xiaoxing in Chinese).</li>
        <li>StarBot is designed by Prof. Jianyu Chen&apos;s startup, Robot Era.</li>
        <li>We are still working on the RL Sim2Real problem for locomotion. <br/>Our ultimate goal is that the robot can perform various complex locomotion skills, such as backflip.</li>
        <li><strong>If you are interested in humanoid robots or Robot Era, <br/>please feel free to contact Prof. Jianyu Chen or me. : )</strong></li>
