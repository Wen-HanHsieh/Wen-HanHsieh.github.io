Hi! I'm **Wen-Han**. I am currently a visiting student at [Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research Lab (BAIR)](https://bair.berkeley.edu), where I'm advised by Professors [Trevor Darrell](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~trevor/), [Koushil Sreenath](https://me.berkeley.edu/people/koushil-sreenath/) and [Haozhi Qi](https://haozhi.io/).

Previously, I obtained my B.S. in MechE at [National Tsing Hua University](https://nthu-en.site.nthu.edu.tw/).

My research interests center around:
- Embodied AI
- Robot Learning
- Dexterous Manipulation

Outside of research, I love playing basketball 🏀 & singing 🎤.

Feel free to contact me through Email or Linkedin, I am happy to coffee chat : )
