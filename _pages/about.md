Hi! I am Yen-Jen Wang, a first-year Ph.D. student at [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu), advised by [Koushil Sreenath](https://me.berkeley.edu/people/koushil-sreenath/) in the [Hybrid Robotics Group (HRG)](http://hybrid-robotics.berkeley.edu) and [Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research Lab (BAIR)](https://bair.berkeley.edu). 

Previously, I obtained M.S. from [Tsinghua University](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), where I was advised by [Jianyu Chen](http://people.iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~jychen/). Prior to that, I completed B.S. in Computer Science at [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/). I have also spent time in [Google](https://www.google.com), [Pony.ai](https://www.pony.ai), [Robot Era](https://www.robotera.com/en/), and [Shanghai Qi Zhi Institute](https://sqz.ac.cn/en) as interns.

My research interests include **Robotics**, **Controls**, and **Embodied AI**, with a particular focus on **Humanoid Robots**. I also love [**competitive programming**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_programming).

If my research or competitive programming interests you, please don't hesitate to drop me an email. : )
