I'm an imcoming PhD student at UC Berkeley. Current, I'm master's student at Tsinghua University advised by **Prof. [Jianyu Chen](http://people.iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~jychen/)**. I also work closely with Prof. [Koushil Sreenath](https://me.berkeley.edu/people/koushil-sreenath/) and [Huazhe Xu](http://hxu.rocks/). Before that, I completed my bachelor's from [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/). 

I am interested in Embodied AI, Reinforcement Learning, Robotics, and Competitive Programming.

If my research or competitive programming interests you and you would like to discuss it further, please don't hesitate to drop me an email. : )
