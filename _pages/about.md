I'm pursuing my master's at the [Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences (IIIS)](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/index.htm), under the guidance of Prof. [Juanyu Chen](http://people.iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~jychen/). Concurrently, I serve as a graduate researcher at [ISR Lab](http://people.iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~isrlab/), Tsinghua University. During the summer of 2023, I had the opportunity to collaborate as a visiting researcher with Prof. [Koushil Sreenath](https://me.berkeley.edu/people/koushil-sreenath/) at the [Hybrid Robotics](https://hybrid-robotics.berkeley.edu/) group, UC Berkeley.

Prior to my master's, I completed my bachelor's from the [Department of Computer Science & Information Engineering](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw//?locale=en) at [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/). I've also interned as a software engineer at Google and Pony.ai.

My research passion lies in machine learning and robotics. I am committed to developing efficient learning techniques for autonomous robots. The goal? Creating robots with resilient and adaptable behaviors to aid humans in a multitude of real-world applications.

**I'm actively seeking a Robotics PhD position for Fall 2024.**
