I'm 1st-year Ph.D. student at [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu), advised by [Koushil Sreenath](https://me.berkeley.edu/people/koushil-sreenath/), and affiliated with [Hybrid Robotics](http://hybrid-robotics.berkeley.edu) and [Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research (BAIR)](https://bair.berkeley.edu). 

Previously, I obtained my master's degree from [Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences (IIIS)](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), where I was advised by [Jianyu Chen](http://people.iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~jychen/), and I collaborate closely with [Huazhe Xu](http://hxu.rocks/). Prior to that, I completed my bachelor's degree at [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/).

My research interests include embodied AI and robotics, with a particular focus on humanoid robots. I also love [competitive programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_programming).

If my research or competitive programming interests you, please don't hesitate to drop me an email. : )
