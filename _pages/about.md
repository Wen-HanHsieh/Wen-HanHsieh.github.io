Hi! I'm **Wen-Han**, an aspiring researcher at [Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research Lab (BAIR)](https://bair.berkeley.edu), where I'm advised by [Trevor Darrell](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~trevor/) and [Koushil Sreenath](https://me.berkeley.edu/people/koushil-sreenath/).

I had completed my B.S. in MechE at [National Tsing Hua University](https://nthu-en.site.nthu.edu.tw/) in June 2025.

My research interests center around:
- Vision-Language Models
- Robotics and Embodied AI
- Multimodal Reasoning and Planning

Every decision and experience I pursue is driven by a long-term commitment to becoming a leading AI researcher. I will be applying to Ph.D. and Master's programs this fall to further this mission.

Feel free to contact me through Email or Linkedin, I am happy to coffee chat : )
