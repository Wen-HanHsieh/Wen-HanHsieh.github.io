I'm a master's student at the [Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences (IIIS)](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/index.htm), under the supervision of Prof. [Jianyu Chen](http://people.iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~jychen/). 

During the summer of 2023, I had the opportunity to collaborate as a visiting researcher with Prof. [Koushil Sreenath](https://me.berkeley.edu/people/koushil-sreenath/) at the [UC Berkeley](https://hybrid-robotics.berkeley.edu/).

Prior to my master's, I completed my bachelor's from the [Department of Computer Science & Information Engineering](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw//?locale=en) at [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/). I've also interned as a software engineer at [Google](https://about.google/) and [Pony.ai](https://www.pony.ai/?lang=en).

My research passion lies in machine learning, robotics, and fundamental models. My research goal is to develop an algorithm that enables a robot to tackle complex tasks, ultimately assisting people in addressing a variety of daily life challenges.

**I'm actively seeking PhD in robotics for Fall 2024.**
