<h5><strong>I'm actively seeking PhD in robotics for Fall 2024.</strong></h5>

I'm a master's student at the [Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences (IIIS)](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) at **[Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/index.htm)**, under the supervision of **Prof. [Jianyu Chen](http://people.iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~jychen/)**, where I work on **reinforcement learning for complex dynamics**.

Besides that, I had the opportunity to collaborate with **Prof. [Koushil Sreenath](https://me.berkeley.edu/people/koushil-sreenath/)** at the **[UC Berkeley](https://hybrid-robotics.berkeley.edu/)**. We delved into **foundational models for robotic low-level action** and **locomotion for legged robots**.

Prior to my master's, I completed my bachelor's from the [Department of Computer Science & Information Engineering](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw//?locale=en) at [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/). 

**With a solid background in programming**, I've interned as a software engineer at [Google](https://about.google/) and [Pony.ai](https://www.pony.ai/?lang=en). Beyond academia and professional life, I'm deeply passionate about [competitive programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_programming) and have been honored with numerous awards from international competitions.

Last but not least, my research passion lies in machine learning, robotics, and fundamental models. My research goal is to **develop algorithms for robots that reduce the cost of skill learning and ultimately enhance their generalization capabilities.** 

If my research or competitive programming interests you and you would like to discuss it further, please don't hesitate to drop me an email. : )
